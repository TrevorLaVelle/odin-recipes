    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This homemade ravioli recipe features delicate pasta pillows filled with a rich and creamy ricotta cheese mixture. It's a delicious and elegant dish that's perfect for special occasions or a cozy dinner at home.</p>
    <p>The ravioli dough is made from scratch using flour, eggs, and a pinch of salt. The filling is a blend of ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and fresh herbs. The ravioli are cooked until tender and served with a simple tomato sauce or a drizzle of browned butter and sage.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce or browned butter and sage</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and a pinch of salt. Make a well in the center and add the eggs. Mix until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, and pepper until well combined.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough into thin sheets. Place small spoonfuls of the filling onto one sheet of dough, spacing them evenly apart. Cover with another sheet of dough and press around the filling to seal.</li>
        <li>Cut the ravioli into individual pieces using a knife or a ravioli cutter. Press the edges to ensure they are sealed.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the ravioli and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Serve the ravioli with tomato sauce or browned butter and sage.</li>
    </ol>
